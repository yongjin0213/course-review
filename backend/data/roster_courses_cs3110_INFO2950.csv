SP26,CS,3110,Data Structures and Functional Programming,"Advanced programming course that emphasizes functional programming techniques and data structures. Programming topics include recursive and higher-order procedures, models of programming language evaluation and compilation, type systems, and polymorphism. Data structures and algorithms covered include graph algorithms, balanced trees, memory heaps, and garbage collection. Also covers techniques for analyzing program performance and correctness.",4,4,GRI,GradeNoAud,Letter grades only (no audit),1,01/20/2026,05/16/2026,Regular Academic Session,O,MAIN,Ithaca,,,,"Students in CS 3110 can register for an optional 1.0-credit Academic Excellence Workshop (AEW) to support their learning. AEWs are collaborative, two-hour weekly problem-solving sessions led by peer educators who have previously taken this course. AEWs are designed to enhance understanding and deeper comprehension; you do not need to be an Engineering student to enroll. Grading is S/U.

FA25,INFO,2950,Introduction to Data Science,"INFO 2950 is an applied introductory course on the foundations of data science, focusing on using data to identify patterns, evaluating the strength and significance of relationships, and generating predictions using data. Topics covered include the core principles of statistical programming (such as data frames, Python/R packages, reproducible workflows, and version control), univariate and multivariate statistical analysis of small and medium-size datasets, regression methods, hypothesis testing, probability models, basic supervised and unsupervised machine learning, data visualization, and network analysis. Students will learn how to use data to make effective arguments in a way that promotes the ethical usage of data. Students who complete the course will be able to produce meaningful, data-driven analyses of real-world problems and will be prepared to begin more advanced work in data-intensive domains.",4,4,GRD,Graded,Letter grades only,1,08/25/2025,12/20/2025,Regular Academic Session,O,MAIN,Ithaca,,,,"For Bowers Computer and Information Science (CIS) Course Enrollment Help, please see: https://tdx.cornell.edu/TDClient/193/Portal/Home/",TR,02:55PM-04:10PM,,Matthew Wilkens (mw966)
