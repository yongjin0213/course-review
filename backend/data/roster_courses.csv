Some TAs were great (mostly the undergraduate ones), but I didn't find the graduate TAs helpful. Labs were long, but understandably so (but don't take it from me, I only had 2 labs that were in person). The first prelim was really easy, but the take home ones afterwards (covid) were really really hard.",2.0,4.0,4.0,2020-07-11T06:25:07.145Z,Edward Suh,,,0.0,False

Homework questions work the same way. I found homework to be way way easier when I was ahead in the class material. Labs suck a lot if you have a bad, unwilling group.

The content is not difficult at all, but Albonesi has a soothing voice and it's easy to fall asleep in class sometimes. Lecture slides are good quality and quite easy to understand. Homeworks aren't particularly difficult, but labs can be quite time consuming. The assigned textbook is generally great supplementary material. Exams are crammable as well.",,2.0,,2018-07-18T05:59:41.966Z,,6,,0.0,False
