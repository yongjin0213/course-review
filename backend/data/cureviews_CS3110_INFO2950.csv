Possibly the best class I've ever taken at Cornell to be honest. 3110 really forces you to approach coding in a different way and you find out just how elegant and neat functional programming can be — I genuinely found a new appreciation for CS even as someone who is not super passionate about it. Assignments are super interesting too — definitely the most fun I've ever had in a CS class. It really feels like you're learning and applying cool new things every time you complete a new assignment.

We had assignments every week that normally took from 6-10 hours, so quite a lot of work, however, they were graded out of 85 so as long as you reach 85 it's automatically 100%.

Attendance is graded but you can choose either a riskier option or a safer one that gives less of a bonus.

You can bring a double-sided cheatsheet into prelims. Prelims are not too hard but there are 3 of them so you have to be consistent.

The final project was really fun — you form a team of up to 4 people and can work on anything you'd like. My team worked on a game and it was super cool being able to integrate OCaml with a GUI.

Most people I knew agreed that this was a pretty heavy inconvenience because of scheduling concerns with people you don't know and the freeloader problem which Clarkson tried and failed to solve. His change to weekly assignments also makes sure that every week you have to spend a nontrivial amount of time on his assignments which can also be pretty annoying if you're not inherently interested in functional programming. I'm honestly not that interested in programming so a lot of the course was pretty boring for me personally. However, many people I knew found this part interesting so it depends on what you like.

Difficulty in coding is probably between CS 1110 and CS 2110. Difficulty in statistics is easier than intro stat classes (ENGRD 2700 or BTRY 3080).",,3,,2018-04-17T21:13:11.235Z,,0,,0,False

The class is extremely difficult and requires a ton of time spent in office hours. Problem sets take on average 10 hours. Means on the midterm and final are extremely low (50s-60s),,5,,2017-11-29T20:50:38.463Z,,4,,0,False
